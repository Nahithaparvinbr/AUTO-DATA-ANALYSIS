# AUTO DATA ANALYSIS

The Auto Dataset Analysis project was conducted using the ISLP (Introduction to Statistical Learning in Python) package to explore, analyze, and model automobile data. The dataset contains various features related to cars such as mileage (MPG), horsepower, weight, acceleration, cylinders, origin, and model year. The project focused on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, relationships, and trends affecting fuel efficiency. Data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, feature selection, and data visualization were applied using Python libraries. Statistical and machine learning models such as Linear Regression were implemented to examine the impact of independent variables (e.g., horsepower, weight) on the dependent variable (MPG). Model performance was evaluated using metrics like R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).Key insights were derived regarding how vehicle weight, engine size, and horsepower influence fuel consumption. The project demonstrates practical application of statistical learning concepts, data visualization, and predictive modeling for real-world automotive data analysis.
